## Description
Slugfolio is a charming command-line tool that helps you slither into the world of portfolios. Just as a banana slug glides through the forest, you'll glide through the prompts, and Slugfolio will leave behind a trail of a beautifully crafted portfolio. Let Slugfolio do the crawling so you can shine in the spotlight!
