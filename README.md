## Description
**Slugfolio** is a charming command-line tool that helps you slither into the world of portfolios. Just as a banana slug glides through the forest, you'll glide through the prompts, and Slugfolio will leave behind a trail of a beautifully crafted portfolio. Let Slugfolio do the crawling so you can shine in the spotlight!

## Features
- Inclue information about yourself such as: Name, location, and bio.
- Add various links such as: LinkedIn, Github, Dribble, Behance, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, and more!
- Create a contact form.
- Add a profile image.

## Installation
To use the application, follow these steps:

- Step 1: Clone the repository
- Step 2: Navigate to the project directory by typing cd slugfolio.
- Step 3: Once you're inside the folder, install the required dependencies by running npm install.

## Usage
To start the application, run the following command: `node index.js`.

When you execute this command, the program will prompt you with a series of questions, including:
- Your name
- Your location
- A breif bio
- Links to your socials

After you provide these details, Slugfolio will automatically generate an HTML file that contains your custom portfolio.

You can then open this generated HTML file in your web browser to view your portfolio.

If you want to personalize the look and feel of your page further, you can easily tweak the generated CSS to match your style.
